major component redesign:
every component has a big struct with everything
when using the unit, condensate every component's struct into one, which is
used in parallel to the army array
-> i actually did it i cant believe it.

i want an overworld map graph
why would you want to traverse the graph? 
  to get better loot 
  to get to the final boss
  to evacuate -> i like this one
what is in the nodes? 
  battles and loot
  
expansion: 
    who are you?
        a small army
    what is the means of transportation?
        a transport airship
        a train
        by foot, they are all vehicles afterall
    what's the thing? the objective?
        planetary explosion, evacuate
        important information dispatching, get to comms facility
        retreat to safety through a battlefield
    do everybody know about the thing?
        no, only you
        yes, everybody is scrambling to save themself
    what's the incentive to not blow up the infrastructure?
        they don't even know
        they need it
    i need battles to happen:
        there is a battlefield
        everybody walks around with an army
        there are enemy entities with the same objective as the player       

raid:
    you and a small army are dropped in enemy territory
    
    the objective is to 
        make a big army
            by exploring and finding stuff
            by battleing and scrapping enemy stuff
            by events
        get to a spaceship
    
    you go around by train, combat troops do not transport themselves
    every station has events/battles/shops
    when you have a large enough army, get to a large spaceship and leave
    the enemy redirects forces to fight you off, so be quick
