view from 6 to the end:
    game is make templates, assemble for army, fight other army
    multiplayer up to 2 ppl
    armies, templates and settings are persistent
    


details:

implement rm unit: -> done, paper note solution

implement armor calculation:
    consider bonuses for damage reduction
    aggregate them and spit out a percentage
    editor remove units funct to make it possible to have a test case
    army has to rebuild grid ref on load
-> done, barely tested

implement augment calculation:
    there are a lot of bonuses to keep track. do one at a time.
    ok add_armor as a malus %
    ok add_damage (only if same damage type weapon) as a bonus %
    ok add_range as a fixed sum
    ok add_cooldown
    ok add_hp
    ok add_speed
-> done, not tested

implement stats hud view:
? stats have to include individual weapon cooldowns and damage, what to do
    either put all as lines in stats (clean, but ugly)
    or modify the components directly (messy)
! put them in stats later

implement sound:
    partially done, need sound design
